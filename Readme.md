🧠 Deepfake Detection with Efficient Transformer

This project detects deepfakes in facial images and videos using a custom vision model that combines EfficientNet for feature extraction and a Transformer Encoder for spatial attention.

📁 Dataset

Trained on the Deepfake Detection Dataset (images organized into Real/ and Fake/ folders).

🧰 Tech Stack

PyTorch for model architecture and training
EfficientNet (via efficientnet_pytorch)
Transformer Encoder for attention
